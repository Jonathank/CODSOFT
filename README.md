#Random Number guess
in this project, we prompt the user to guess anumber generated by the computer, the number is then checked,
if found true, amessage to a user is returned plus the number. however if the user guesses a greater number,
a message stil is return notifying them that they choose a number greater than the generated number and so other wise
when the user guessed number is smaller.
user only enters the number 3 times, if they fail to guess the exact number, the game ends but still will ask the user if they
still want to play and continue, if yes, they have to confirm with Y
